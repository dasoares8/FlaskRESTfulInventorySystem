# FlaskRESTfulInventorySystem
Inventory System in Python using Flask RESTful

## Description
This is an inventory system. It is basic at the moment (just users, brands, and items) but will grow over time.

##Implementation
This is code that demonstrates
  - Usage of a REST API using Flask RESTful
  - Usage of SQAlchemy as an ORM (vs. using direct SQL)
  - Usage of FlaskJWT for authorization
  - General Python3 OO coding
  
I have used Postman for REST API testing. This has been developed using JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition.
